Hans Selye coined the term General Adap- tation Syndrome to refer to how the adrenal gland responds to a noxious stimulus (stressor) (164, 165). This response begins with an initial alarm reaction that includes a reduction of function but is followed by an increase in resistance to the stress above the previous baseline function. This increase in resistance to the stress is referred to as adaptation; when the stressor is exercise, it is called training adaptation. The key to continued beneficial adaptation to the stress is the timely removal of the stimulus (e.g., exercise) so that function can recover, and then reapplication of an often-increased stress (progressive overload). It is important for strength and conditioning profes- sionals to have a basic understanding of the hormonal responses to resistance exercise. Hormonal signals play roles in a variety of mechanisms from anabolic (to build) to permissive (to allow) and catabolic (to break down). It is important to understand that the changes in the cir- culatory responses in the blood are but one observable change that some resistance training programs produce due to the metabolic challenges. One can also see ana- bolic responses with heavy programs that upregulate androgen receptors to use available anabolic hormones without any change in the blood concentrations (e.g., two or three sets with 1-repetition maximum [1RM] intensity and 5 to 7 minutes of rest between sets); and while endocrine signals are involved with signaling, the changes in the circulatory blood concentrations are much more subtle and must be observed at the level of the receptor. Gaining such insights and knowledge into how the endocrine system interacts with an exer- cise prescription can enable strength and conditioning professionals to better understand the details of how hormones help to mediate optimal adaptations to resis- tance training (93, 96). Although resistance training is the only natural stimulus that causes dramatic increases in lean tissue mass (i.e., muscle hypertrophy), significant differences in resistance training programs’ ability to produce increases in muscle and connective tissue size exist (44, 128, 189). The selection from among the acute program variables (intensity, sets, order of exercise, rest period duration, and exercise selection) for a resistance exercise session dictates in large part the appearance and magnitude of hormonal responses (105, 113-115, 117, 166, 169, 189). Importantly, tissue adaptations are influenced by the changes in circulating hormonal con- centrations following exercise (10, 12, 14, 47, 62, 98, 171), and manipulating the endocrine system naturally through the proper selection for each acute program variable can enhance the development of target tissues and improve performance (78, 158). Thus, understanding this natural anabolic activity that occurs in the athlete’s body during and following exercise is fundamental to successful recovery, adaptation, program design, training progression, and ultimately athletic performance (42-44, 93, 94, 101, 103)."

        "heading": "The relatively new term neuroendocrinology refers",
        "content": "to the study of the interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine system. Typically, endocrine glands are stimulated to release hormones by a chemical signal received by receptors on the gland or by direct neural stimulation. For example, the adrenal medulla (the internal part of the adrenal gland) releases the hormone epinephrine upon neural stimulation from the brain (91, 104, 112, 182). The adrenal cortex (the outer part of the adrenal gland) synthesizes and secretes the hormone cortisol after stimulation by another hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, released from the pituitary gland (110, 111, 116). Following stimulation, endocrine glands release hormones into the blood, which carries the hormones (and thereby the signal) to hormone-specific receptors located on the surface (peptide hormones) or in the cytosol (steroid hormones and thyroid hormones) of the target tissue cells (6-8, 11, 37, 61). In addition to endocrine function via release into blood circulation, hormones can be secreted to function via intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine mechanisms. Intracrine and autocrine secretion of a hormone means that the cell releases the hormone to act upon the cell itself, via binding to intracellular and membrane recep- tors, respectively. It may be stimulated to do so via an external stimulus (e.g., another hormone), but the secreted hormone never enters the blood circulation. For example, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can be produced inside the muscle fiber when stimulated by mechanical force production or growth hormone(s) interactions with the muscle cell. Paracrine secretion of hormones involves the release of a hormone to interact with adjacent cells, without moving into the blood cir- culation. These mechanisms demonstrate the multiple roles that hormones can play in their interactions with a target cell. A variety of binding proteins that carry hormones are found in the blood (6, 8). These many binding proteins carry both peptide hormones and steroid hormones. In a sense, these binding proteins act as storage sites within the circulation, help to fight degradation of the hormone, and extend its half-life. Most hormones are not active unless they are separated (free) from their specific bind- ing protein. However, some hormone-binding proteins may actually have biological actions themselves. For instance, sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), the binding protein from testosterone and estrogen, can bind to specific membrane receptors and initiate activation of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway (50). Thus, binding proteins, whether circulating in the blood or bound to a cell receptor, are major players in endocrine function and regulation. The interactions of bound hormones with receptors are just beginning to become appreciated in the field of endocrinology, and recent research has suggested the existence of even more complex regulation of hormones and target tissues (135). Many hormones affect multiple tissues in the body (1, 3, 82, 84-86). Testosterone or one of its derivatives, for example, interacts with almost every tissue in the body. In this chapter we focus on skeletal muscle tissue as the primary target of hormonal interactions; but many other tissues, such as bone, connective tissue, kidney, and liver, are just as important to the adaptive changes observed with resistance training. It must be remembered that the whole cascade of physiological events, includ- ing hormonal signaling, is a result of the activation of motor units to create movement (i.e., size principle). The demands and magnitude of any physiological response are related to this need created by activated motor units. The amount of muscle tissue activated by the exercise dictates which physiological system is needed and how involved it is to meet the homeostatic demands of force/power production during the exercise and for the demands of recovery. For example, heart rate will be much higher to support an 80% of 1 RM squat exercise performed for 3 sets of 10 repetitions with 2 minutes rest between sets than the same protocol done for bicep curls. While similar systems will be involved with both, exer- cise protocol differences will exist based on the amount of muscle tissue mass affected by the protocol. Hormonal systems are also involved with other target tissues and glands that were stressed in a particular workout, but again, their needs are also dictated by the specific neural recruitment demands and their involvement to support movement. Thus, a five-set 5RM workout has different demands than a one-set 25-RM workout in its motor unit activation and its need for physiological support and recovery. Most hormones play multiple physiological roles."

In addition, hormones interact with each other in complex ways.

Such complexity and flexibility allow the endocrine system to respond in the proper magnitude to a physiological challenge and to interact differently with various physiological systems or target tissues at the same time."

Thyroid hormones act as important permissive hormones that allow the actions of other hormones to take place. As another important action in the building of tissue, anabolic hormones also block the negative effects on protein metabolism of catabolic hormones, such as cortisol and progesterone, which can degrade cell proteins. The negative effects of cortisol on skeletal muscle can also be seen in its roles to inactivate immune cells or block other signaling pathways such as the Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway involved in mRNA translation initiation. The interrelatedness of hormones, muscle fibers, and the subsequent changes in functional capabilities of muscle fibers provides the basis for the adaptive influence of hormones in hypertrophy. Yet again, the effect of hor- mones represents only one of the possible mechanisms for skeletal muscle adaptation to resistance training."

        "heading": "Hormonal Changes",
        "content": "The signal from a hormone (and thereby its biological effect) is relayed only to cells that express the receptor for that specific hormone. This ensures that the hormonal signal affects only the target tissue and not all cells in the body. Typically, the hormone is trying to influence cellular metabolism or affect DNA transcription in the nucleus (remember that muscle cells are multinucleated). Because many hormones cannot cross the cell mem- brane, their signal has to be transmitted throughout the cell via secondary messengers (often in the form of a cascade of reactions that ultimately interact and mediate the signal to the DNA machinery in the multiple nuclei of the muscle cell or single nuclei of typical cells). Receptors are generally either integrated into the cell membrane (polypeptide hormone receptors) or in the cytosol (steroid and thyroid hormone receptors). Every cell, from muscle fibers to immune cells to brain cells, has receptors to mediate the message or the signal from some hormone. One of the basic principles in endocri- nology is that a given hormone interacts with a specific receptor. This principle is generally referred to as the lock-and-key theory (41) (in which the receptor is the lock and the hormone is the key; figure 4.2); however, it is now known that the hormone–receptor interaction is much more complex than this simple lock-and-key theory conveys. Although only one hormone has exactly the right characteristics to bind to and fully induce a signal via a specific receptor, in cases of cross-reactivity a given receptor partially interacts with other hormones (i.e., allosteric binding or blocking of the primary bind- ing site). Similarly, receptors can have allosteric bind- ing sites at which substances other than hormones can enhance or reduce the cellular response to the primary hormone. Finally, some hormones may need to be in an aggregated form (several hormones linked together) to produce the optimal signal via the receptor; this is believed to be the case for growth hormone, where one sees that the high molecular weight molecules do not have immune binding but do bind to bioactive receptors in the tibial line assay (65). When an adaptation is no longer possible (e.g., the maximal amount of protein has been added to the muscle fiber) (54) or “overstimulation” by a hormone has occurred (e.g., insulin resistance), receptors can become less responsive or even nonresponsive to a specific hor- mone, preventing it from stimulating further actions in"

This inability of a hormone to interact with a receptor is called downregulation of receptor function. Receptors have the ability to increase or decrease their binding sensitivity, and the actual number of receptors present for binding can also be altered. Alterations in the receptor’s binding characteristics or the number of receptors can be as dramatic an adaptation as the release of increased amounts of hormone from an endocrine gland. Obviously, if a receptor is not responsive to the hormone, little or no alteration in cell metabolism will result from that hormone. For example, it has been shown for the hormone testosterone that exercise training affects only the maximal number of receptors, not the binding sensitivity of the receptor (31). Scientists are just starting to study and understand the role that changes in receptors play in muscle adaptions to exercise training."

After diffusing across the sarcolemma, the hormone binds with its receptor to form a hormone–receptor complex (H-RC), causing a conformational shift in the receptor and thus activating it. The H-RC then binds to another H-RC and moves to the nucleus, where it arrives at the DNA. The H-RC “opens” the double-stranded DNA in order to expose transcriptional units that code for the synthesis of spe- cific proteins.

As few as one or two heavy resistance exercise sessions can increase the number of androgen receptors, the receptor for testosterone, in the muscle (126, 192). In addition, local inflammatory processes related to tissue damage and repair mechanisms are acti- vated by stress and run their time course with recovery (20).

However, if the stress is too great, catabolic actions in the muscle may exceed anabolic actions as a result of, among other factors, the inability of anabolic hormones to bind to their receptors or the downregulation of receptors in the muscle tissue (31, 129). Thus, hormonal actions are important both during and after an exercise session to respond to the demands of the exercise stress (45-47). As noted before, the magnitude of the hormonal response (i.e., anabolic or catabolic) depends on the amount of tissue stimulated, the amount of tissue remodeling, and the amount of tissue repair required consequent to the exercise stress (51, 143). Thus, again, the characteris- tics of the exercise stimulus (i.e., selection among the acute program variables) are paramount to the hormonal response to the exercise protocol (94, 96)."

Second, because adaptations to heavy resistance exercise typi- cally are anabolic, the recovery mechanisms involved are related to increases in the size of muscle cells. Third, errors in exercise prescriptions can result in a greater catabolic effect or a lack of an anabolic effect (ineffective exercise program).

For instance, neural activation of muscle fibers increases hormone binding affinity of receptors in muscle. The integration of the nervous system and the various hormonal mech- anisms is different in trained and untrained people (73, 161). In addition, certain hormonal mechanisms for exercise-induced hypertrophy, such as those mediated by testosterone, are not fully operational in both sexes or at all ages (38, 100, 115). A wide array of hormonal mechanisms with differential effects (based on program design, training level, sex, age, genetic predisposition, and adaptation potential) provides myriad possible adap- tation strategies for the maintenance or improvement of muscle size and strength (99)."

This is just one biocompartment that can be monitored, and it must be viewed in the context of all of the other processes stimulating muscle and pro- tein synthesis (e.g., neural factors, the branched-chain amino acid leucine). Hormone concentrations can be determined from blood samples drawn from athletes at various stages of exercise and training. One can also measure hormones in the fluid surrounding the muscle or within the muscle itself (151). Although interpretation of blood concentrations of hormones can be tricky, as this is only one part of the whole hormonal response puzzle, such data provide an indication of the status or responses of the glands or of the functional status of the mechanisms controlled by the hormone. It should be noted that peripheral concentrations of hormones in the blood do not indicate the status of the various receptor populations or the effects of a hormone within the cell. It is typically assumed, however, that large increases in hormone concentration indicate higher probabilities for interactions with receptors. There is little doubt that an increase in circulatory concentrations, in the absence of a plasma volume reduction, means that there was an increase in release from the endocrine glands. The physiological outcome from this increase now depends on the “status” of the receptor in the target tissue—that is, can the hormonal signal be realized in the cell by the binding to the receptor and the translation of the signal to the DNA machinery or other intracellular targets (e.g., mTOR pathway)? More difficult to interpret are decreases in hormonal concentrations that might indicate several possible fates for the hormone, including higher uptake into the target tissue receptors, greater degrada- tion of the hormone, decreased secretion of the hormone, or some combination of these. In addition to these direct effects on hormones, many different physiological mech- anisms contribute in varying degrees to the observed changes in peripheral blood concentrations of hormones with exercise, including circadian pattern, fluid volume shifts (exercise tends to push fluid from the blood to the intercellular compartment), tissue clearance rates (time spent in a tissue), venous pooling of blood, and hormone interactions with binding proteins (18, 24, 25, 89). These mechanisms interact to produce a certain concentration of a hormone in the blood, which influences the potential for interaction with the receptors in target tissue and their subsequent secondary effects, leading to the final effect of the hormone on a cell. Thus, when one is determining the specific effects of exercise on hormones, one must consider many different interpretations. An increase in hormonal concentrations in the blood is not a prerequi- site for seeing gains in muscle size or strength but does represent an increased activation for hormonal release of the endocrine gland involved. ▶ ▶Hormone responses are tightly linked to the characteristics of the resistance exercise protocol."

        "content": "the Endocrine System Although organs such as muscle and connective tissue are the ultimate targets of most resistance training programs, many adaptations occur within the endocrine system as well. In other words, when one trains muscles, endocrine glands are also being trained. As noted before, the involvement of any endocrine gland is dependent on how much support is needed by that gland’s secretions to support the activated motor units. If one just does wrist curls for sets of 15, it is doubtful that any endocrine gland will be stimulated to increase release of hormones, as the normal homeostatic concentration of hormones going though circulation would be able to meet the needs of such a minor muscle group exercise. However, local receptors would be upregulated in the muscle tissue involved to meet the needs for the motor units used for that exercise. Adaptations are related to changes in the target organs and the toleration of exercise stress. The potential for adaptation in the endocrine system, with so many different sites and mechanisms that can be affected, is great. The following are examples of the potential types of adaptation that are possible: •\t Amount of synthesis and storage of hormones •\t Transport of hormones via binding proteins •\t Time needed for the clearance of hormones through liver and other tissues •\t Amount of hormonal degradation that takes place over a given period of time •\t How much blood-to-tissue fluid shift occurs with exercise stress •\t How tightly the hormone binds to its receptor (receptor affinity); this is an uncommon response to exercise training •\t How many receptors are in the tissue •\t The change in the content and in some cases the size of the secretory cells in the gland •\t The magnitude of the signal sent to the cell nucleus by the H-RC or secondary messenger •\t The degree of interaction with the cell nucleus (which dictates how much muscle protein to produce) Hormones are secreted in response to a need for homeostatic control in the body; the endocrine system is part of an overall strategy to bring physiological functions back into normal range (60). These homeo- static mechanisms controlled by the endocrine system can be activated in response to an acute (immediate) resistance exercise stress or can be altered by chronic (over longer periods of time) resistance training (32, 55, 57, 64, 73, 81, 172, 173, 184). The mechanism that mediates acute homeostatic changes to acute resistance exercise stress is typically a sharp increase or decrease in hormonal concentrations to regulate a physiological variable, such as glucose level. A more subtle increase or decrease usually occurs in chronic resting hormonal concentrations in response to resistance training (172)."

Although circulating testosterone concentration is important for the anabolic signal, it is the binding of testosterone to its receptor that is the key to stimulating anabolic functions. Therefore, an increase in circulating testosterone (free, bound, or both) concen- tration is not an absolute marker of this event. However, increased testosterone concentration does provide an indirect marker of motor unit activation and metabolic demands beyond hemostatic conditions and typically is associated with increased receptor binding. Heavy resistance training using one or two repetitions in low volume, which may not cause any changes in testoster- one concentrations after a workout, could potentially still increase the absolute number of receptors and thus binding sites available to testosterone; however, this effect on receptors has yet to be fully elucidated (171, 188).

It can promote growth hormone release from the pituitary, which can influence protein synthesis in muscle; and in turn growth hormone appears to have a permissive or synergistic effect on testosterone’s promotion of protein synthesis (138). The potential interactions with other hormones and other signaling systems demonstrate the highly interdependent nature of the neuroendocrine–immune system in influencing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. The effects of testosterone on the development of strength and muscle size are also related to the influ- ence of testosterone on the nervous system (12, 90)."

Although not a consistent finding, some data show small testosterone, especially for free testosterone, increases in women after resistance exercise (188). Variations in testosterone’s cellular actions consequent to resistance exercise thus may be attributed to differences in the cell membrane, perhaps because of the forces placed on membranes with resistance exercise, or to different feedback mech- anisms sending signals to the higher brain centers (e.g., higher levels of testosterone feeding back on the brain to decrease luteinizing hormone secretion). Furthermore, receptor interactions may be quite different under differ- ent exercise conditions due to the differential force on the membrane (31). High-intensity aerobic endurance exercise can cause a dramatic catabolic tissue response, and increases in testosterone may be related to the need for protein synthesis to keep up with protein loss (179, 180). Despite increased testosterone, hypertrophy does not typically take place with aerobic endurance training (119). In fact, oxidative stress may actually promote a decrease in muscle fiber size in order to optimize oxygen transport into the cell (119). Without the proper exercise stimulus, the cellular mechanisms that mediate muscle fiber growth are not activated to the extent that hypertrophy occurs. In boys and younger men (<18 years), several factors appear to influence acute serum testosterone concen- trations and might affect whether significant increases occur during or following exercise. Key among these factors is the onset of puberty. Since testosterone pro- duction in prepubescent boys is very low, these boys lack sufficient quantities to induce noteworthy hypertrophy."

When blood is sampled 4 or more hours after exercise and not immediately following it, other factors, such as diurnal variations (normal fluctuations in hor- mone levels throughout the day) or recovery phenom- ena, can affect the magnitude or direction of the acute stress response (32). Additionally, possible rebounds or decreases in testosterone blood values over time may reflect augmentation or depression of diurnal variations (103), making interpretation of late blood samples yet more difficult. Recent evidence demonstrates that acute resistance exercise does not appear to affect the diurnal changes in testosterone (122, 163). In men, testosterone concentrations are typically highest in the morning and drop with time through the day, but increases can occur at any point in the circadian pattern with exercise. However, the magnitude of change is smaller when resting concentrations are smaller, thus leading to lower absolute concentrations with exercise despite the fact that increases do occur. To date, time of day of strength training (e.g., morning or afternoon) has not been shown to have significant effects on the resting total testoster- one concentrations, its diurnal pattern, or the absolute increase in maximum strength (163). Women have much lower concentrations of serum testosterone and little variation in concentrations during the day (although there are limited data to support the latter contention). However, the response of their androgen receptors is very dynamic with a much faster upregulation than in men, likely to better use the amount of testosterone present with a resistance exercise stimulus (188). Thus, an elevation in testosterone in the blood in women fol- lowing resistance exercise might have an impact as it is ▶ ▶Large muscle group exercises using an ade- quate volume of total work result in acute increased total testosterone concentrations in men. more quickly responded to with receptor changes to use the newly available testosterone in the blood."

        "content": "and Sex Hormone–Binding Globulin The acute exercise responses of free testosterone (tes- tosterone not bound to a binding protein, such as sex hormone–binding globulin for transport) are beginning to be better understood. Free testosterone accounts for only 0.5% to 2% of total testosterone; thus higher total testosterone concentration allows for more free testos- terone. Heavy resistance exercise (e.g., six sets of 10 repetitions at 80% of 1RM) can acutely increase free testosterone in men and women, although the increase is much smaller for women (188). For men, Kraemer and colleagues (120) showed that age appears to affect free testosterone responses to resistance exercise. In other words, younger (i.e., 30-year-old) men had higher concentrations of free testosterone after a workout than older (i.e., 62-year-old) men. This might indicate greater biological potential for testosterone to interact with the target tissues in younger men. The so-called free hormone hypothesis states that it is only the free hormone that interacts with target tissues. Nevertheless, the bound hormone could significantly influence the rate of hormone delivery to a target tissue, such as muscle, and this may be an advantage that younger men have over older men after a workout (34). That is, younger men have more absolute values for total testosterone and thus more free testosterone on a percentage value of total than older men. The role, regulation, and interaction of binding pro- teins and their interactions with cells also present inter- esting possibilities for force production improvements, especially for women, whose total amount of testoster- one is very low in comparison with that of men. Muscle cell stimulation of growth keeps testosterone around longer in a bound state. In fact, the binding protein itself may act as a hormone with biological activity (159). The biological role of various binding proteins appears to be an important factor in tissue interactions (71, 72, 75, 159). Studies by Kvorning and colleagues (130, 131) have demonstrated that for younger men, testosterone is a major player in the anabolic responses to resistance training. When subjects were given luteinizing hormone blockers, which resulted in very low testosterone con- centrations but did not affect other anabolic signaling systems, gains in muscle strength and lean tissue mass were reduced when compared to those of normally functioning men with normal testosterone concentra- tions. These classic studies demonstrate how important endogenous testosterone is in the adaptive mechanisms for resistance training adaptations."

Impor- tantly, one has to realize that testosterone increases in response to the demands of an exercise protocol; then the receptors either increase binding to use the elevated testosterone or they do not due to a lack of need for the signal to increase muscle-related metabolism. It may well be that other receptors on other target tissues (e.g., nervous, satellite cells) are more affected at certain time points in training depending on the window of adaptation available in the target tissues. So expecting increases in resting concentrations may be an outmoded concept; but one might expect an increase in the exercise-induced concentrations due to improved functional capacity and the ability to do more work in an exercise protocol. It appears that training time and experience may be very important factors in altering the resting and exer- cise-induced concentrations of this hormone. Its role in skeletal muscle might change, however, as upper limits of muscle cell size increases are achieved. In adult men, acute increases in testosterone are observed if the exer- cise stimulus is adequate (i.e., multiple sets, 5-10RM, adequate muscle mass used). In a classic study, Häkkinen and colleagues (73) demonstrated that over the course of two years of training, even in elite weightlifters, small increases in resting serum testosterone concentrations do occur, concomitant with increases in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which are involved in regulation of testosterone production and are released and secreted from the anterior pituitary in response to signals from the brain via the hypothalamus. Testoster- one might have a role in nervous system development in long-term training by augmenting the neural adaptations that occur for strength gain in highly trained strength and power athletes (75, 76). Furthermore, some studies have shown greater resistance training adaptation when the training program sessions induced acutely elevated testosterone concentrations (78, 158). Research on the effect of resistance exercise and training on the androgen receptor (the receptor for tes- tosterone) is limited; however, recently several studies have been published underscoring the current interest in this topic (126, 156, 187, 188, 192). The findings vary, showing both increases and decreases in androgen receptor content; however, these differences might stem from variations in exercise protocols as well as the time point for tissue sampling. Despite these varying findings, it appears that resistance exercise and training ultimately increase the muscle androgen receptor content. With the increase in androgen receptor binding, the use of tes- tosterone is enhanced. Additionally, nutritional intakes before a workout can cause upregulated skeletal muscle androgen content and are a reason why ingesting protein and some carbohydrate before a workout appears to be important (126)."

        "content": "There is a great amount of confusion about what GH is and what it is responsible for in the human body. Growth hormone in recent years has taken on a new complexity in both exercise and medicine. The primary hormone that arises from the DNA machinery is the 191 amino acid polypeptide (called a monomer with molecular weight of 22 kDa) that is produced in the somatotroph of the anterior pituitary gland: in two types of somatotrophs, band 1 (containing smaller molecular weight forms, e.g., 22 kDa) and band 2 (containing large molecular weight forms such as aggregates). Due to the advances of the radioimmunoassay in the 1960s and 1970s, the 22 kDa has been the primary form that has been assessed in the blood; this has blinded our view of what is going on with the other larger concentrations of aggregate forms until recent years. It is now clear that the world of pituitary GH endocrinology is much more complex than previ- ously appreciated when only the 22 kDa variant was investigated. The blood is filled with GH splice variants and, more importantly, its many aggregates (i.e., multi- ple disulfide bonds linking together GH monomers) in different molecular weight combinations. Additionally, making the scenario more complex is the presence of two types of GH binding proteins that also make higher molecular weight forms (e.g., GH monomer bound with a GH binding protein). At present, scientists are just starting to unravel the complex regulatory roles this superfamily plays. Interestingly, there is a much higher concentration of bioactive GH (i.e., aggregates) when compared to just the 22 kDa GH monomer. This leads one to believe that we have gotten only a small glimpse of what GHs are doing in the body. Demonstrating that we are not completely clear as to the physiological role of the 22 kDa monomer, in medicine it has been impli- cated in cancer involving its interactions with liver IGF-I release (154). Thus, the aggregate forms of GH might be the important biologically functional relevant GH involved in adaptation to exercise (128). Again, the majority of studies in exercise endocrinol- ogy have examined the 22 kDa isoform due to the ease and popularity of immunoassays (often termed radio- immunoassay [RIA], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], or enzyme immunoassay [EIA]). These techniques depend on antibody interactions to determine the amount present in the blood. The antibodies used are generally specific to the 22 kDa GH variant, and thus many other forms remain undetected or underdetected with such assay techniques. Nevertheless, the current model for the regulation and targets of various forms of GH is as shown in figure 4.6. The multitude of physi- ological mechanisms and target tissues that have been linked to GH mediation have indicated for some time a need for a superfamily of hormones to achieve such diversity of effects. Growth hormone is important for the normal devel- opment of a child, but it also appears to play a vital role in adapting to the stress of resistance training. A study by McCall and colleagues (139) found a positive correlation between GH responses and muscle fiber hypertrophy following 20 weeks of resistance training, yet it is possible that other GH variants followed a pat- tern of increase similar to that of the 22 kDa form and could also explain the relationship. This highlights the problems with using simple regression to determine a hormone’s effects; and since “cause and effect” is not dictated by simple regression, great caution is needed with such interpretations for any hormone. The target tissues for GH are highly variable, and different molec- ular weight variants have different target tissues, which include bone, immune cells, skeletal muscle, fat cells, and liver tissue. The main physiological roles of GH and its superfamily are the following (albeit clarity is lacking as to which molecular form of the GH superfamily is directly responsible for the given role): •\t Decreases glucose utilization •\t Decreases glycogen synthesis •\t Increases amino acid transport across cell mem- branes •\t Increases protein synthesis •\t Increases utilization of fatty acids •\t Increases lipolysis (fat breakdown) •\t Increases availability of glucose and amino acids •\t Increases collagen synthesis •\t Stimulates cartilage growth •\t Increases retention of nitrogen, sodium, potas- sium, and phosphorus •\t Increases renal plasma flow and filtration •\t Promotes compensatory renal hypertrophy •\t Enhances immune cell function The secretion of GHs is regulated by a complex system of neuroendocrine feedback mechanisms (23, 39, 128, 136, 157, 170, 193). Many of the hormone’s actions might be mediated by a secondary set of hormones or even be the result of other GH forms, but GH in its many forms interacts directly with target tissues. The 22 kDa GH form both stimulates the release of IGFs at the auto- crine level of the cell, contributing to the overall changes in IGFs in the body, and increases the availability of amino acids for protein synthesis. This results in condi- tions that promote tissue repair in general and perhaps in recovery following resistance exercise. Insulin-like growth factor may be released from nonhepatic tissues (e.g., fat, white blood cells), including muscle itself, which may not produce as much endogenous IGF as other body tissues (28, 45, 77). Nevertheless, GH plays a crucial role in direct cellular interactions as one of the most potent anabolic hormones (139). The secretion of the 22 kDa GH, and thus the amount in the blood, varies according to time of day, with the highest levels observed at night during sleep (40, 98, 170). However, the higher amounts of bioactive GH have not been shown to have a circadian pattern. The 22 kDa form of release of GH is pulsatile, or burst-like; these pulses also have different amplitudes throughout the day, and exercise appears to increase their amplitude and number. It has been hypothesized that nocturnal increases are involved in various tissue repair mechanisms in the body. Thus, it is possible that GH secretion and release may directly"

Growth hormone (22 kDa) concentrations increase in response to breath holding and hyperventilation alone (33), as well as to hypoxia (177). It appears that a substantial stimulus for 22 kDa GH release is increased hydrogen ion (drop in pH) and lactate concentrations (64). Not all resistance exercise protocols demonstrate increased serum GH concentra- tion. Vanhelder and colleagues (184) observed that when a light load (28% of 7RM) was used with a high number of repetitions in each set, no changes in the serum con- centration of the 22 kDa GH occurred. It appears that an intensity threshold must be reached in order to elicit a significant 22 kDa GH response to resistance exercise, especially when longer rest periods (>3 minutes) are used (113). This may be due to the metabolic connection with glycolytic metabolism (at least for the 22 kDa variant). Depending on the load, rest, exercise volume, and exercise selection of a resistance exercise protocol, different 22 kDa GH responses occur (5, 43, 44, 139, 143, 166, 167, 174). In a study designed to determine the different variables related to GH increases, Kraemer and colleagues (113) found that serum increases in the 22 kDa GH are differentially sensitive to the volume of exercise, the amount of rest between sets (less rest, higher 22 kDa GH), and the resistance used (10RM produces higher lactate values and higher 22 kDa GH responses). When the intensity used was 10RM (heavy resistance) with three sets of each exercise (high total work, approximately 60,000 J) and short (1-minute) rest periods, large increases were observed in serum 22 kDa GH concentrations. The most dramatic increases occurred in response to a 1-minute rest period when the duration of exercise was longer (10RM vs. 5RM). Because such differences are related to the configura- tion of the exercise session (e.g., rest period length), it appears that greater attention needs to be given to pro- gram design variables when physiological adaptations to resistance training are being evaluated. ▶ ▶Growth hormone release is affected by the type of resistance training protocol used including the duration of rest period."

Hormone concentrations and hormone responses to exercise vary with menstrual phase (29), although the mechanisms of this variation are unclear. Kraemer and colleagues (114, 117) found that during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, women had significantly higher 22 kDa GH concentrations at rest compared with men. Furthermore, with use of a heavy resistance exercise protocol characterized by long rest periods (3 minutes) and heavy loads (5RM), 22 kDa GH concentrations did not increase above resting concentrations. However, when a short-rest (1 minute) and moderate-resistance (10RM) exercise protocol was used, significant increases in serum 22 kDa GH values were observed. Hormonal response patterns to different resistance exercise routines may vary over the course of the menstrual cycle owing to alterations in resting levels (114, 117); furthermore, the use of hormonal contraception (e.g., estrogen-con- taining birth control pills) appears to increase the 22 kDa GH response to resistance exercise (127). However, the response patterns of men and women to the same resistance exercise protocol are similar when workouts (e.g., short rest results in a higher 22 kDa GH elevation compared to long rest period workouts) are compared (114). Studies show that the bioactive GH is also made of many different molecular sizes based on what molecular sizes bind together (e.g., two monomers bound together results in a dimer or a 44 kDa form, and so on as GH monomers are added together) (128). Interestingly, in women, bioactive GH has been shown to be altered by resistance training. It appears that the resting concentra- tions are increased while little change occurs in the 22 kDa form (125). In addition, concentrations of bioactive GH are not as high in older women as in younger women, and resistance exercise is a more potent stimulus to bio- active GH than endurance exercise (65). Initial research showed that contraceptives also have minimal effects on bioactive GH forms. Furthermore, higher concentrations of bioactive GH are observed in women who have greater strength, also suggesting the importance of the higher aggregated forms of GH (123). These new insights on the GH hormone again demonstrate the potential com- plexity of the endocrine system and show that we have much more to learn about these important signals to tissues. The effects of periodizing resistance training over the course of the menstrual cycle remain to be examined, and more research is needed to elucidate any sex-related neuroendocrine adaptation mechanism (43). At present, women’s reduced concentrations of testosterone and different resting hormonal concentrations over the course of the menstrual cycle appear to be their most striking neuroendocrine differences from men."

The reduction in the 22 kDa GH exer- cise-induced responses with training perhaps indicates potential interactions with other molecular weight forms. Individual responses over a nine-month period were highly variable, with no significant group changes over time in a group of elite weightlifters (unpublished observations). This likely means that higher amounts of aggregate GH were being produced; the 22 kDa form is becoming less important as the study of the pituitary gland continues due to the majority of GH being held in aggregate or bound form. This is a hot area of cur- rent and future research. As already noted, initial data indicate that resting concentrations and some molecular weight forms of GH are also influenced by long-term resistance training in women (125). At present it would appear that the exercise-induced responses of the 22 kDa GH are what change with training with little change in the resting concentrations, except for small menstrual phase increases and decreases. For the bioactive GH in contrast to the 22 kDa monomere GH form, it is the resting concentrations that may see the most changes with subtle alterations in some bioactive fractions of higher than 22 kDa molecular weight (125).

Insulin-like growth factor I is a 70 amino acid poly- peptide, and IGF-II is a 67 amino acid polypeptide; the function of the latter is less clear. Again, a superfamily of peptides exists along with binding proteins. The liver secretes IGFs after 22 kDa GH stimulates liver cells to synthesize IGFs. Besides GH, factors such as thyroid hormone and testosterone are also involved in the regulation of IGF synthesis (193-196). Typical of many polypeptide hormones, both growth factors are synthesized as larger precursor molecules, which then undergo processing to form the other variants of the active hormones themselves. Insulin-like growth factors travel in the blood bound to binding proteins; in the target tissue, IGFs disassociate from the binding protein and interact with the receptors (1, 175, 176). Blood levels of IGFs are usually measured as either total levels (bound plus free) or free IGF concentrations."

Binding proteins are important factors in the trans- port and physiological mechanisms of IGF (22, 23, 49). Insulin-like growth factor has been shown to stimulate the secretion of its own binding proteins from within the muscle cell itself, thus modulating the cell’s responsive- ness to IGF (140). The circulating IGF binding proteins play an important role in restricting access of the IGF peptides to receptors and are influenced by 22 kDa GH concentrations. Other factors, such as nutritional status and insulin levels, also have been shown to be important signal mechanisms for IGF release. The nutritional influ- ence on IGF transport, production, and regulatory control is a dramatic variable affecting its cellular interactions. Acute changes in nitrogen balance and protein intake and nutritional status affect a variety of mechanisms (22, 121, 139).

It too is a superfam- ily of polypeptides and binding proteins with dramatic implications for health and performance (148). The exact reasons for acute increases in blood levels of IGF-I are unknown but are probably related to the disruption of various cells, including fat and muscle cells, because these cells manufacture and store IGF (183). Insulin-like growth factor I exists across different biocompartments (blood, interstitial fluid [ISF], and muscle), and whether circulating IGF-I responses to exercise reflect what is going on in local fluids surrounding the muscle has been examined. In that study of men and women, it was shown that the increase in circulating total and free IGF-I was not correlated with increases in interstitial fluid IGF-I concentrations or muscle IGF-I protein content (151)."

This seems to indicate that IGF is released from storage sources other than the liver, that release is due to cellular disruption of cells that already contain IGF, or that GH-mediated release of IGF with certain types of exercise has a different time course from that in injection–response studies. Systematic alterations in circulatory concentrations of IGF in response to various types of exercise protocols appear to be closely related to regulatory factors of IGF release and transport (13). Evaluation of serum changes over longer periods is nec- essary for assessment of specific effects and relationships to GH in the serum (46).

At rest, fat cells contain relatively high con- centrations of IGF, and skeletal muscle has very little of its own. However, mechanical stimulation, overload, and stretch of muscle cells, as in resistance exercise, cause them to substantially increase their production of IGF-I. Insulin-like growth factor I produced in muscle is often referred to as mechano growth factor, and it exerts autocrine functions (63, 141). It has been sug- gested that autocrine actions of mechano growth factor are the primary actions of IGF-I in muscle. It has also been proposed that IGF-I splice variants may regulate myoblast differentiation through the actions of mature IGF-I and not the E peptides, so examination of this topic remains of great interest (137). It is possible that IGF may be released from nonhepatic cells without the mediation of GH (1, 2, 45, 77, 82, 83). In addition, cells may produce and keep IGFs so that the IGFs exert their effect without entering the peripheral circulation. Although IGF-I has been shown to be responsive to exercise in some studies, this does not follow a classic endocrine response (i.e., stimulus of gland by exercise resulting in hormone release into the blood) in all cases. It was shown that IGF-I was responsive to resistance exercise in men and women, but in those studies the starting concentrations were lower (113, 114). In another study the concentrations were higher and, despite increases in immunoreactive (22 kDa) GH, no increase in IGF-I was observed (118). From these studies it has been theorized that the starting level of IGF-I may be a factor in determining whether an increase is observed with exercise (i.e., no increases if starting concentrations are high, an increase if starting concentrations are low). A study by Kraemer and colleagues (121) supported this theory, but it was also shown that the IGF-I concentra- tions were more sensitive to acute caloric loads, which included carbohydrate and protein supplementation before and after a workout (figure 4.7)."

Additionally, the intake of food or the level of caloric restriction (or both) influences the resting and exercise-induced concentrations in the blood (80, 109). In women, resistance training was shown to increase total IGF-I and reduced IGF binding protein-1 concentrations during acute resistance exercise, indi- cating that exercise mode-specific adaptations in the circulating IGF-I system can occur (67). The effects of training are still an ongoing story as to the many different aspects of the IGF superfamily response patterns (149). As with GH, training-induced adaptations in IGF-I are probably reflected in a variety of mechanisms related to type of IGFs, release, transport, and receptor inter- action. Furthermore, the interaction with other anabolic hormones cannot be ignored, as these often target the same outcome (e.g., protein synthesis).

The adrenal hormones most important to training and conditioning are cortisol, a glucocorticoid from the adrenal cortex, and the catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and enkephalin-containing polypeptides (e.g., peptide F) from the adrenal medulla (95, 104, 109, 116, 182).

If a greater number of receptors are bound with testosterone and this receptor complex then blocks the genetic element on the DNA to which cortisol and its receptor complex can bind, protein is conserved or enhanced. Conversely, if a greater number of receptors are bound to cortisol, protein is degraded and lost.

It is interesting that selection among the acute program variables that produce the highest catabolic responses in the body also produces the greatest GH response (116, 166, 178). Thus, though chronic high levels of cortisol have adverse effects, acute increases may be a part of a larger remodeling process in muscle tissue. Muscle must be disrupted to a certain extent (below injury levels) to remodel itself and enlarge; acute elevations in cortisol would help in this remodeling process by helping to remove damaged proteins. Because of the catabolic role of cortisol, athletes and strength and conditioning professionals have much interest in its potential as a whole-body marker of tissue breakdown. To a certain extent, cortisol is such a marker, but the magnitude of increase may need to be greater than 800 nmol/L to indicate potential overtraining problems (55, 56, 58, 59). The testosterone-to-cortisol ratio also has been used in the attempt to determine the anabolic– catabolic status of the body (70). Although such markers are attractive conceptually, serum cortisol measurements and the testosterone-to-cortisol ratio have met with only limited success in predicting or monitoring changes in strength and power capabilities (124). Problems with these tests probably have to do with the multiple roles of cortisol and other hormones. Few studies have investigated the effect of resistance exercise on glucocorticoid receptors in muscle tissue, but recent data indicate that in trained men, significantly lower concentrations of receptors are found at rest and over a recovery period of 70 minutes after exercise when compared to those in women (188). Concomitantly, women with the same exercise protocol decreased and then increased their androgen binding capacity over the 70 minutes following exercise, whereas men saw only a continual downregulation. This indicates that women dealing with a lower concentration of testosterone more rapidly upregulated androgen receptors whereas gluco- corticoid receptors were already upregulated before the workout."

Yet with a heavy 5RM protocol, women did not exhibit an increase in cortisol concentrations in the blood, whereas men did. This indicates a differential stimulus between the sexes, yet the receptor responses of immune cells to cortisol are similar. Such data indicate that different target tissues might respond differentially to cortisol as well as to other hormone signals. It is probable that vast differences are observed in the physiological role of cortisol in acute versus chronic exercise responses to resistance exercise. Acute cortisol responses may reflect the metabolic stress of the exer- cise, and chronic aspects may be primarily involved with tissue homeostasis entailing protein metabolism (45, 51). Thus, cortisol’s role in overtraining, detraining, or injury may be critical when muscle tissue atrophy and decreases in force production capabilities are observed (133). Such roles remain to be demonstrated; however, cortisol’s role in suppressing function of cells of the immune system (e.g., B and T cells) has a direct impact on the recovery and remodeling of skeletal muscle tissue. This impact of cortisol on immune cells can be dramatic, with the main effect one of “inactivating” immune cell functions, which partially contributes to the immune suppression observed after intense exercise stress (51). With heavy resistance exercise, glucocorticoid receptor expression in B cells decreased with exercise and increased during recovery, demonstrating a greater binding, which in turn would reduce B cell activity during recovery (52). The effects were somewhat attenuated in women compared to men of similar training levels, indicating a sex difference in the magnitude of the responses. ▶ ▶Resistance exercise protocols that use high volume, large muscle groups, and short rest periods result in increased serum cortisol values (119).

In addition, epinephrine has been correlated to lactate concentrations with exercise stress. Adrenal responses are not involved in the recov- ery responses until the stress is removed. Some specific endogenous opioid peptides (i.e., proenkephalins) are secreted by the adrenal medulla and affect the immune system, which is critical in recovery from exercise stress (182). If training is not varied, continued stress keeps the adrenal gland engaged, and recovery is delayed due to the secondary responses of cortisol and its negative effects on immune system cells and protein structures. Long-term continued high stress can even lead to adre- nal exhaustion, at which point the ability of the adrenal medulla to release catecholamines is diminished."

        "content": "•\t Use high volume, large muscle groups, and short rest periods to expose the body to an adrenergic stress. But be careful to vary the training protocol and the rest period length from short to long over time, provide days of complete rest, and use lower-volume workouts to allow the adrenal gland to engage in recovery processes, to reduce stress on the adrenal medulla so as not to experience adrenergic exhaustion, and to reduce stress on the adrenal cortex and prevent chronic cortisol secretions from the adrenal cortex. This way, the stress of the exercises will not result in a nonfunctional overreaching or overtraining. body and helping with the adaptive response to heavy resistance training. Whether trying to optimize a work- out or avoid overtraining, the strength and conditioning professional must remember that the endocrine system plays an important role. The goal of this chapter has been to provide an initial glimpse into this complex but also highly organized system that helps to mediate changes in the body with resistance exercise training."
