The author would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of Everett Harman to this chapter. The strength and conditioning professional with a broad understanding of exercise science can effectively use tests and measurements to make training decisions that help athletes achieve their goals and maximize their potential. Tests and measurements form the objective core of the evaluation process. This chapter covers the reasons for testing, testing terminology, evaluation of test quality, the selection of appropriate tests, and aspects of proper test administration."

Baseline measurements can be used to establish starting points against which achievable goals can be set, and testing at regular intervals can help track an athlete’s progress in reaching those goals. Using tests as a basis for goal setting allows coaches to set specific goals for individual athletes that, when taken together, help to accomplish group or team objectives (see chapter 8 for more information about goal setting)."

That judgment is not difficult if the candidate has already excelled at the sport elsewhere and is of adequate body size. However, in many cases, candidates have not clearly demonstrated their competitive abilities or may lack experience in the sport. The coach then needs some way of determining whether the candidate has the necessary basic physical abilities that, in combination with technique training and practice, could produce a competitive player. Field tests serve as tools for such assessment."

The following terms and definitions are widely accepted and are used in this text: test—A procedure for assessing ability in a particular endeavor. field test—A test used to assess ability that is per- formed away from the laboratory and does not require extensive training or expensive equipment (8). measurement—The process of collecting test data (14). evaluation—The process of analyzing test results for the purpose of making decisions. For example, a coach examines the results of physical performance tests to determine whether the athlete’s training pro- gram is effective in helping achieve the training goals or whether modifications in the program are needed. pretest—A test administered before the beginning of training to determine the athlete’s initial basic abil- ity levels. A pretest allows the coach to design the training program in keeping with the athlete’s initial training level and the overall program objectives. midtest—A test administered one or more times during the training period to assess progress and modify the program as needed to maximize benefit. formative evaluation—Periodic reevaluation based on midtests administered during the training, usually at regular intervals (2). It enables monitoring of the ath- lete’s progress and adjustment of the training program according to the athlete’s individual needs. It also allows evaluation of different training methods and collection of normative data. Regular modification of the training program based on formative evaluation keeps the training program fresh and interesting and helps avoid physical and mental staleness. posttest—Test administered after the training period to determine the success of the training program in achieving the training objectives."

The validity of tests of basic athletic abilities or capacities is more difficult to establish.

Construct validity refers to overall valid- ity, or the extent to which the test actually measures what it was designed to measure (21). Face validity, content validity, and criterion-referenced validity, defined next, are secondary to and provide evidence for construct validity. To be valid, physical performance tests should mea- sure abilities important in the sport, produce repeatable results (see the later section on reliability), measure the performance of one athlete at a time (unless otherwise specified in the protocol), appear meaningful, be of suitable difficulty, be able to differentiate between var- ious levels of ability, permit accurate scoring, include a sufficient number of trials, and withstand the test of statistical evaluation.

If a test or test item has face validity, the athlete is more likely to respond to it positively (1). The assessment of face validity is generally informal and nonquantitative. In other fields, such as psychology, tests may be deliberately constructed to have poor face validity because if examinees realize what a test or test item is supposed to measure, they can answer deceptively to manipulate their scores. For tests of basic athletic abilities, however, face validity is desirable based on the assumption that anyone taking a test of physical ability wants to do well and is thus motivated by a test that appears to measure a relevant capability."

For athletic testing, these include all the component abilities needed for a particular sport or sport position. Examples of compo- nent abilities in athletics are jumping ability, sprinting ability, and lower body strength (34). For example, a test battery for potential soccer players should include, at minimum, tests of sprinting speed, agility, endur- ance, and kicking power. To ensure content validity, the test developer should list the ability components to be assessed and make sure they are all represented on the test. In addition, the proportion of the total score attributable to a particular component ability should be proportional to the importance of that component to total performance. While the terms face validity and content validity are sometimes used interchangeably, the latter relates to actual validity while the former relates to the appearance of validity to nonexperts (1)."

Concurrent validity is the extent to which test scores are associated with those of other accepted tests that measure the same ability. Criterion-referenced validity is often estimated statistically. For example, a Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient based on the scores on a new body fat assessment device and those from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry would provide a measure of the concurrent validity of the new test."

Convergent validity is the type of concurrent validity that field tests used by strength and conditioning professionals should exhibit. A test may be preferable to the gold standard if it exhibits convergent validity with the standard but is less demanding in terms of time, equipment, expense, or expertise. Predictive validity is the extent to which the test score corresponds with future behavior or performance. This can be measured through comparison of a test score with some measure of success in the sport itself. For example, one could calculate the statistical correlation between the overall score on a battery of tests used to assess potential for basketball and a measurement of actual basketball performance as indicated by a compos- ite of such quantities as points scored, rebounds, assists, blocked shots, forced turnovers, and steals. Discriminant validity is the ability of a test to distin- guish between two different constructs and is evidenced by a low correlation between the results of the test and those of tests of a different construct (2). It is best if tests in a battery measure relatively independent ability components (e.g., flexibility, speed, aerobic endurance). Good discriminant validity of tests in a battery avoids unnecessary expenditures of time, energy, and resources in administering tests that correlate very highly with each other."

        "heading": "Reliability",
        "content": "Reliability is a measure of the degree of consistency or repeatability of a test (2, 15). If an athlete whose ability does not change is measured two times with a perfectly reliable test, the same score is obtained both times. On an unreliable test, an individual could obtain a high score on one day and a low score on another. A test must be reliable to be valid, because highly variable results have little meaning. However, even a reliable test may not be valid, because the test may not measure what it is supposed to measure. For example, both the 60 m (66-yard) dash and the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run are reliable field tests, but only the 1.5-mile run is considered a valid field test for aerobic fitness. It is also possible for a test to be highly reliable for one group (e.g., college tennis players) but only moderately reliable for another group (e.g., high school tennis players) because of differences in physical or emotional maturity and skill level, which can affect test performance. There are several ways to determine the reliability of a test; the most obvious one is to administer the same test several times to the same group of athletes. Statistical correlation of the scores from two administrations pro- vides a measure of test–retest reliability. Any difference between the two sets of scores represents measurement error. Another statistic that can be calculated is the typ- ical error of measurement (TE), which includes both the equipment error and biological variation of athletes (15). The difference between two sets of scores can arise from a number of different factors (2): •\t Intrasubject (within subjects) variability •\t Lack of interrater (between raters) reliability or agreement •\t Intrarater (within raters) variability •\t Failure of the test itself to provide consistent results ▶ ▶Reliability is a measure of the degree of consistency or repeatability of a test. A test must be reliable to be valid, because highly variable results have little meaning. Intrasubject variability is a lack of consistent perfor- mance by the person being tested. Interrater reliability, also referred to as objectivity or interrater agreement (2), is the degree to which different raters agree in their test results over time or on repeated occasions; it is a measure of consistency. A clearly defined scoring system and competent scorers who are trained and experienced with the test are essential to enhance interrater reliabil- ity. For example, even a test that appears simple, such as timing a 40-yard (37 m) dash with a stopwatch, can exhibit both random and systematic error if the timer is not trained and experienced. Sprint times obtained using handheld stopwatches are typically shorter than those obtained using automatic timers, because raters using stopwatches exhibit reaction-time delay when pressing the start button in response to the gun but do not delay in pressing the button at the finish line because they can see the athlete approaching. Interrater reliability is particularly important if different scorers administer tests to different subgroups of athletes. A subgroup with a relatively lenient scorer will have artificially inflated scores. To get an accurate measure of improvement, the same scorer should test a group at the beginning and the end of the training period. If there are two scorers and the scorer at the beginning is more or less lenient than the scorer at the end, the resulting measurements may be worthless for comparative purposes. Consider a situation in which an athlete is tested in the squat. If the pretest scorer is more lenient (requiring less depth on the squat) than the posttest scorer, the athlete may achieve a lower test score on the posttest despite having made a significant improvement in strength."

Different testers may motivate athletes to different degrees, based on factors such as personal- ity, status, physical appearance, demeanor, and sex. A common scenario that increases interrater variability occurs when the coach tests some of the athletes while an assistant tests others. The athletes may be inspired to do better on the tests administered by the coach. Intrarater variability is the lack of consistent scores by a given tester. This differs from interrater reliabil- ity, which refers to the degree of agreement between different testers. For example, a coach eager to see improvement may unintentionally be more lenient on a posttest than on a pretest. Other causes of intrarater variability include inadequate training; inattentiveness; lack of concentration; or failure to follow standardized procedures for device calibration, athlete preparation, test administration, or test scoring. To avoid such prob- lems, accurate and consistent athletic testing should be a priority for all strength and conditioning professionals."

For example, in choosing an appropriate test for running ability in basketball, the strength and conditioning professional must understand that basketball is predom- inantly an anaerobic running sport (3, 23) and also be familiar with the distances and directions of sprints in a basketball game.

The number of one-leg hops needed to travel 27 yards (25 m) may represent a valid and reliable test of plyometric strength for an experi- enced long jumper but not for a novice (8). Testers must also consider the training status of the athletes being tested. It would not be ideal, for example, to ask a baseball player to perform a 3-mile (4.8 km) run test a week before the beginning of fall practice, because the player has probably been doing interval training and relatively short runs (29).

A test of the maximum number of chin-ups that can be performed may be a valid test of elbow flexion muscular endurance for male wrestlers, but it may not be as valid for females due to differences in upper body pulling strength (24).

The effects of temperature and humidity on testing perfor- mance can create problems for comparing the results of tests administered at different times of year, on different days, and even at different times of day. For example, the maximal oxygen uptake of an athlete impaired by the heat is underestimated by the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run test. Run times can also be impaired by cold temperatures. Thus, outdoor aerobic endurance tests may be inappro- priate at locations characterized by wide fluctuations in temperature.

Athletes who arrive at a relatively high altitude after living near sea level for an extended period of time should be given at least 10 days to acclimatize before undergoing aerobic endurance tests (31). For all testing, it is good practice to measure and document the environmental conditions and then to consider these factors when interpreting the results. ▶ ▶Athletes’ experience, training status, age, and sex can affect test performance, so these factors should be considered in test selection.

The strength and conditioning professional must remain attentive to the health status of athletes, especially before, during, and after maximal exertions that occur during training, testing, and competition. Strenuous exercise, such as maximal runs or 1-repetition maximum (1RM) tests, can uncover or worsen existing heart prob- lems, such as impaired blood flow to the heart muscle and irregular heartbeats. Standard medical screening cannot always reveal hidden heart problems, which occasionally result in fatality among young athletes (27). Heat injury is also a risk during heavy physical exertion in hot environments, especially when humidity is high. Athletes should wear light clothing in warm weather and drink water ad libitum according to the dictates of thirst before and during heavy physical exertion in the heat (refer to chapters 9 and 10 for more detailed hydration guidelines). Musculoskeletal injuries can also be a problem. If symptoms are ignored, recovery can be greatly delayed. Medical referral may be warranted for an athlete who persistently has any of the following symptoms: chest pressure, pain, or discomfort; listlessness; light-headed- ness; dizziness; confusion; headache; deeply reddened or cold and clammy skin; irregular pulse; bone or joint pain; blurred vision; nausea; or shortness of breath, rapid pulse, or weakness either not commensurate with the level of exertion or unresponsive to rest.

The main consideration here is the number of athletes that are being tested. It is preferable to have the same person administer a given test if time and schedules permit, because this eliminates the issue of interrater reliability. If this is not feasible, the test supervisor can allow simple, well-defined tests (such as counting correct push-ups) to be administered by different testers and tests requiring schooled judgment (as of proper form in the squat) to be scored by the most skilled and experienced personnel.

A tester can administer up to two nonfatiguing tests in sequence to an athlete as long as test reliability can be maintained.

When multiple trials of a test (e.g., the repeated trials it takes to find a 1RM) or a battery of tests is performed, allow complete recovery between trials (28). There should be at least 2 minutes of rest between attempts that are not close to the athlete’s maximum and 3 min- utes between attempts that are close to the maximum, as judged by the relative difficulty of the previous trial or testing set (19). When administering a test battery (e.g., one in which wrestlers perform maximal repeti- tion pull-up and push-up tests for assessment of local muscular endurance), tests should be separated by at least 5 minutes to prevent the effects of fatigue from confounding test results (also see the following section, “Sequence of Tests”)."

Strength and conditioning professionals should be aware that responses to exercise in the heat are highly individual. 2.\t Avoid testing under extreme combinations of heat and humidity. Figure 12.1 lists the combinations of temperature and humidity at which heat injury risk is present. Using temperature limits at least 5 °F (3 °C) below those listed is recommended, especially on sunny days, to provide a safety margin and enable better test performance. On days when the temperature has exceeded or is expected to exceed the recommended limits, indoor facilities should be used if available; or testing should be conducted during morning or early evening hours when temperatures are acceptable. 3.\t The athletes, especially those coming from cool climates, should be acclimatized to the heat and humidity for at least one week before testing. Start with short workouts and progress to workouts of longer duration. 4.\t Athletes should make sure they are well hydrated in the 24-hour period preceding aerobic endurance testing in the heat. A good indication of adequate hydration is a plentiful volume of clear urine (refer to chapter 9 for more detailed preexercise hydration guidelines). Salt tablets should generally be avoided. 5.\t Athletes should be encouraged to drink during exercise in the heat. Plain water is most appropriate for exercise up to 1 hour in duration. Snack breaks during longer durations of training can help replen- ish fluids and be important in replacing electrolytes. The amount and rate of fluid replacement depend on individual sweat rates, duration of exercise, and environment. Refer to chapter 9 for specific guide- lines and how to calculate sweat rate if needed. 6.\t Athletes should wear a light-colored, loose-fitting tank top and shorts that are breathable (i.e., syn- thetic porous, moisture-wicking material). Male athletes may be allowed to go shirtless. 7.\t Heart rate may be monitored to detect reactions to the heat. 8.\t Be attentive to possible symptoms of heatstroke or heat exhaustion: cramps, nausea, dizziness, dif- ficulty in walking or standing, faintness, garbled speech, lack of sweat, red or ashen skin, and goose bumps. 9.\t Be aware of the symptoms of hyponatremia or water intoxication, a potentially fatal condition in which excess water intake reduces blood sodium to dangerously low levels. Symptoms may include extremely dilute urine in combination with bloated skin, altered consciousness, or loss of conscious- ness, with no increase in body temperature. A victim of hyponatremia should never be given fluid and should be treated by a physician. 10.\t Proficient medical coverage should be readily available so that an athlete encountering a test-related health problem can be very rapidly treated or evacuated (or both). between tests to ensure test reliability. The fundamental principle with test sequencing should be that one test should not affect the performance of a subsequent test. This should allow for optimal performance in each test and also allows for valid comparisons with previous testing results. For example, a test that maximally taxes the phosphagen energy system requires 3 to 5 minutes of rest for complete recovery (5, 9), whereas a maximal test of the anaerobic glycolytic energy system requires at least 1 hour for complete recovery (7). Therefore, tests requiring high-skill movements, such as agility tests, should be administered before tests that are likely to produce fatigue and confound the results of subsequent tests. A logical sequence, although there are some vari- ations, is to administer tests in this order: 1.\t Nonfatiguing tests (e.g., height, weight, flexibil- ity, skinfold and girth measurements, vertical jump) 2.\t Agility tests (e.g., T-test, pro agility test) 3.\t Maximum power and strength tests (e.g., 1RM power clean, 1RM squat) 4.\t Sprint tests (e.g., 40 m sprint with split times at 10 m and 20 m) 5.\t Local muscular endurance tests (e.g., push-up test) 6.\t Fatiguing anaerobic capacity tests (e.g., 300-yard [275 m] shuttle) 7.\t Aerobic capacity tests (e.g., 1.5-mile [2.4 km] run or Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test)"

        "content": "The test order should also be designed to require min- imal recovery time between tests, allowing for a more efficient testing session. An effort should be made to administer fatiguing anaerobic capacity tests and aerobic tests on a different day than the other tests. However, if performed on the same day, these tests should be per- formed last, after an extended rest period. It is important that test sessions be conducted at the same time of day to avoid fluctuations in physiological responses due to differences in circadian rhythm (30). It is also recommended that tests be conducted indoors, which will allow for climate and testing surfaces to remain more consistent. ▶ ▶The order of tests should be designed in such a way that the completion of one test does not adversely affect performance in subsequent tests."

If this is done, it should be repeated at all future testing sessions. One strategy could be to incorporate familiarization of the tests into training sessions. The instructions should cover the purpose of the test, how it is to be performed, the amount of warm-up recommended, the number of practice attempts allowed, the number of trials, test scoring, criteria for disallowing attempts, and recommendations for maximizing perfor- mance. The instructions that are given to the athletes need to be clear and concise as this will increase the reliability and objectivity of the test (22). As an important supplement to reading test instruc- tions aloud, the test administrator or a competent assis- tant should demonstrate proper test performance when possible. The athletes should be given opportunities to ask questions before and after the demonstration. The test administrator should anticipate questions and have answers prepared. It is important to motivate all athletes equally rather than giving special encouragement to only some. Whenever possible, tell athletes their test scores immediately after each trial to motivate them to perform better on subsequent trials (2)."

Both types of warm-ups include body movements similar to those involved in the test. An organized, instructor-led general warm-up ensures uniformity. It is acceptable to allow two or three activity-specific warm-up trials, depending on the test protocol, and have subsequent trials actually count toward the score. Depending on the test protocol, the score can be the best or the average of the post-warm-up trials (2). ▶ ▶General and specific warm-ups performed before a test can increase the test’s reli- ability."
