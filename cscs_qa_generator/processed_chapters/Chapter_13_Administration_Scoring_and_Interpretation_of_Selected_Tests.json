The author would like to acknowledge the significant contributions of Everett Harman and John Garhammer to this chapter. As discussed in chapter 12, the strength and conditioning professional—often referred to as tester in this chap- ter—who has a broad understanding of exercise science can effectively choose and use tests and measurements to make training program decisions that help athletes optimize their physical preparation and maximize their potential. To do this effectively, the tester must admin- ister tests correctly, analyze test data accurately, and then combine the results of selected tests to generate an athletic profile. This chapter covers these basic aspects of testing performance-related parameters and provides comprehensive age- and sport-specific descriptive and normative data for selected tests."

In this case, muscular strength is related to the force a muscle or muscle group can exert in one maximal effort while maintaining proper form, and it can be quantified by the maximum weight that can be lifted once (the 1-repetition maximum [1RM]) in exercises such as the bench press or back squat, the maximum force exerted isometrically (against an immovable object) as measured with a transducer, or the maximum force that can be exerted at a particular isokinetic speed (5, 6, 31, 48, 70, 71, 73, 77, 90). As 1RM tests do not require expensive equipment and reflect the kind of dynamic ability necessary in sport, they are the maximal strength tests of choice for most strength and conditioning professionals. In general, 1RM tests are administered after the ath- lete has warmed up by performing a few sets of the test exercise with submaximal loads, beginning with a rela- tively light load. The first attempt is usually with approx- imately 50% of the athlete’s estimated 1RM weight. After the athlete has rested enough to feel recovered from the previous attempt (1-5 minutes, depending on the difficulty of the attempt), the strength and conditioning professional increases the weight somewhat, based on the ease with which the previous trial was performed."

High-speed maximal muscular power tests are often called (maximal) anaerobic power tests."

As explosive exercise tests take about 1 second while low-speed maximal strength tests generally require 2 to 4 seconds to complete, phosphocreatine and adenos- ine triphosphate (ATP) stored in the active muscle(s) are the primary energy sources for both types of tests. Maintaining correct technique or form is also important when measuring anaerobic power for both performance validity and safety reasons. ▶ ▶Most maximal muscular strength tests use relatively slow movement speeds and there- fore reflect low-speed strength. Assessment of high-speed muscular strength can involve measuring the 1RM of explosive resistance training exercises or the height of a vertical jump. Power output reflects both force and velocity. The height of a jump is a function of the force put into the ground and the velocity at which the athlete leaves the ground. An athlete may not improve in jump height after gaining body weight during a resistance training cycle, making it appear that power output is unchanged. However, because the athlete is heavier and propels the body to the same height, indicating the same takeoff velocity, an increase in power output is evident. This applies to any test in which body weight is manipulated (e.g., running up stairs). Moving a heavier body at the same speed requires a higher power output. An alternative class of anaerobic power tests involves the use of a cycle ergometer. This type of test can be advantageous for the strength and conditioning pro- fessional in some injury situations in which running is restricted or when the athlete participates in a non-body- weight-support sport such as rowing or cycling.

        "content": "most commonly used test of this type is the Wingate anaerobic test. A field test protocol involves use of a cycle ergometer with mechanical means of adjusting resistance and measuring pedal revolutions and rate (rpm). In a laboratory setting, an electronically instru- mented ergometer can simplify parameter measurement and improve accuracy. Typical protocols involve a basic warm-up followed by a 30-second test interval (27). In this test, resistance is applied quickly after the individual reaches a near-maximal pedaling rate (typically 90 to 110 rpm). The resistance applied is proportional to body weight; the percentage is greater for trained athletes than for individuals with less training. Work performed is determined from the resistance value and number of pedal revolutions. Power is generally calculated as work divided by time for each 5-second time interval during the 30-second test. Parameters typically calculated include peak power, average power, and a fatigue index such as a ratio of maximum to minimum interval power. Norms for cycle ergometer tests are available (47, 73)."

A test of local muscular endurance should be performed in a continuous manner for several seconds to several minutes without the advantage of rest periods and without extraneous body movements. Examples include performing a max- imal number of repetitions in the chin-up, parallel bar dip, or push-up exercises or a resistance training exercise using a fixed load (e.g., a percentage of an athlete’s 1RM or body weight) (26, 64, 70, 73)."

Few strength and con- ditioning professionals have the equipment to measure oxygen consumption directly, so aerobic capacity is generally estimated by performance in aerobic endurance activities such as running 1 mile (1.6 km) or more (45, 79, 88). It can also be estimated using other field tests such as the maximal aerobic speed (MAS) test (60) and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (9, 13, 58, 59)."

Agility consists of two main compo- nents: speed in changing direction and cognitive factors (101). More recently the definition of agility has been revised to take into account the perceptual qualities, and it is now considered “a rapid, whole-body, change of direction or speed in response to a sports-specific stim- ulus” (101, 108). Agility testing is generally confined to physical capacity tests such as change-of-direction speed or cognitive components such as anticipation. Tests such as the T-test, 505 agility, and pro agility test are used to assess change of direction."

The time taken to sprint from a stationary start over a short distance such as 10 yards (9.3 m) reflects acceleration, whereas longer sprints such as 40 yards (37.1 m) would measure maximum speed (126). Tests of speed are not usually conducted over distances greater than 100 m (109.4 yards) because longer distances reflect anaerobic or aerobic capacity more than absolute ability to move the body at maximal speed (73, 90, 126)."

However, many tests of speed and agility are administered using hand timing with a stopwatch, which can be a major source of measurement error, especially if the tester is not sufficiently trained. Even under ideal conditions, stopwatch-measured sprint times are up to 0.24 seconds faster than electronically measured times because of the tester’s reaction-time delay in pressing the stopwatch button at the gun and the tendency to anticipate and press the button early as the athlete approaches the finish line (31, 44, 91). Therefore strength and conditioning profes- sionals are encouraged to use electronic timing devices for tests of speed and agility when they are available. It is also more informative to measure split times, as this can provide the strength and conditioning professional with insight into the speed and acceleration capacities of the athletes. For example, times for 10 yards (9.1 m), 20 yards (18.3 m), and 40 yards (36.6 m) can be recorded and used to calculate split times and maximal velocity. Finally, tests of speed and agility require proper footwear and a nonslip surface."

Typical devices for measuring flexibility include manual and electric goniometers, which measure joint angle, and the sit-and-reach box, which is used to evaluate the combined flexibility of the lower back and hips. Flexibility measurements are more reliable when standardized warm-up and static stretching precede the flexibility assessment. During a flexibility test, the ath- lete should move slowly into the fully stretched position and hold this position. Ballistic stretching, characterized by bouncing to increase range of motion, cannot be allowed during any flexibility testing (45, 79). A number of physical competency screens are avail- able for strength and conditioning professionals and can be used to assess overall flexibility, mobility, and general movement competency of athletes. However there is no current consensus on which screen to use or a clearly established link between results of screening and injury (68, 84). Good strength and conditioning professionals perform postural and performance screening routinely by viewing the athletes’ performance in training. For example, the overhead squat is a common exercise that is used as a part of movement screens as it is able to assess bilateral mobility of hips, knees, and ankles along with shoulder and thoracic spine (3, 16, 93)."

Stability is a measure of the ability to return to a desired position following a disturbance to the system (73). Athletes with poor balance are at a greater risk of lower limb injuries (52, 53). Athletes have also been shown to have greater balance compared to nonathletes (23). Balance testing can be used to assess stability increases with training and in a number of different ways (73). Commonly used tests include timed static standing tests (eyes closed and standing on one or both legs) (14, 66), balance tests using unstable surfaces (66), and tests using specialized balance testing equipment (NeuroCom, Biodex Balance System) (90). These include a large number of tests that can evaluate different aspects of balance and stability (73). The balance error scoring system (BESS) and star excursion balance test (SEBT) have very good reliability and a substantial body of literature supporting their use (14, 41, 43, 73, 83, 111)."

Although there are sophisticated and expensive devices capable of partitioning the lean component into bone and nonbone lean tissue, the body composition procedures typically performed by strength and conditioning professionals use the basic two-compartment (fat and lean) model. With a trained and competent tester, the skinfold mea- surement technique is the most valid and reliable (r = 0.99) means for assessing body fatness that is generally available to the strength and conditioning professional and is preferable to body circumference methods (65), although dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and under- water (hydrostatic) weighing are often labeled as the “gold standards.” The skinfold method uses calipers that measure the thickness of a double layer of finger-pinched skin and subcutaneous fat. A good skinfold measurement device should squeeze the fold of skin and fat with con- stant pressure regardless of the amount of tissue being measured (28, 45, 88). Circumference methods may be added, as they are relatively quick and simple and can yield important chronic disease risk information. For example, waist circumference can assess abdominal fat, and a high waist circumference is associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and certain types of cardiac disease (45)."

Height is usually measured without shoes to the nearest quarter-inch or half-centimeter (73). The most accurate body mass or body weight mea- surement is performed with a certified balance scale, which is generally more reliable than a spring scale and should be calibrated on a regular basis (73). A calibrated electronic scale is an acceptable alternative. Athletes should be weighed while wearing minimal dry clothing (e.g., gym shorts and T-shirt, no shoes). For comparison measurements at a later date, they should dress similarly and be weighed at the same time of day.

The environmental conditions should not differ from test to test. For any particular test conducted on the ground, the surface should always be the same and should not be wet for one test and dry for another. Maximum strength tests should use the same type of racks with the supports set at the same height for a given athlete. For jumping tests, the type of equipment used should be consistent. Athletes should never be tested after fatiguing sport activities or workouts. They should arrive for testing normally hydrated and with standard nutrition before commencing the testing. Standardization of testing also includes not taking supplements before performing the test (e.g., creatine monohydrate can enhance perfor- mance on some tests) (119). It is best to perform tests and retests at approximately the same time of day (92). Warm-up for the tests should be standardized and should include both a general dynamic warm-up such as jogging or light calisthenics and a specific warm-up that involves movements like those required by the test, such as prac- tice of the test at submaximal intensity. Familiarization and practice of the tests to be performed by the athletes are also critical aspects. Stretching is appropriate for any test requiring flexibility."

This requires a rough estimate of how high the particular athlete will jump, but a correction can be made on the second attempt if necessary. 3.\t Without a preparatory or stutter step, the athlete performs a countermovement by quickly flexing the knees and hips, moving the trunk forward and downward, and swinging the arms backward (figure 13.2a).

This is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. Median—the middlemost score when a set of scores is arranged in order of magnitude. With an even number of scores, the median is the average of the two middlemost scores. Half a group of scores falls above the median and half falls below the median. Depending on the distribution of scores, the median can be a better measure of central tendency than the mean. This is particularly true when very high or very low scores of one or a few members of the group tested raise or lower the group mean to the extent that it does not adequately describe the ability of most group members. Mode—the score that occurs with the greatest fre- quency. If each numerical score appears only once, there is no mode. If two or more scores are “tied” for greatest frequency, then all of the similar scores are modes. The mode is generally regarded as the least useful measure of central tendency."

The advantage of the range is that it is easy to understand; the disadvantage is that it uses only the two extreme scores and so may not be an accurate measure of variability (110). For example, the range could be the same for a group of widely dispersed scores as for a group of scores that are narrowly dispersed except for one deviant score. The standard deviation is a measure of the variability of a set of scores about the mean. The formula for the standard deviation of a sample is as follows: (13.1) where S refers to a summation, x is a score, x¯ is the mean of the scores, and n is the sample size (number of scores). A relatively small standard deviation indicates that a set of scores is closely clustered about the mean; a large standard deviation indicates wider dispersion ∑ − − x x n"

The standard deviation is most useful when the group of scores is “normally distributed,” forming the bell-shaped curve shown in figure 13.21 (18, 51). The z score can be used to express the distance of any individual score in standard deviation (SD) units from the mean: z = (x − x¯ ) / SD (13.2) For example, if an athlete runs the 40-yard (37 m) sprint in 4.6 seconds and the mean and standard deviation for the group tested are 5.00 and 0.33 seconds, respectively, equation 13.2 can be applied to determine that the z score for that athlete is −1.2. In other words, the ath- lete’s score is 1.2 standard deviation units below (i.e., faster than) the group mean. Graphs can be a useful way of representing z scores visually. This can provide the strength and conditioning practitioner with a comparison of different physical capacities and provide assistance with making decisions on which weaknesses to target with a training program (figure 13.22). In the example shown, the strength and conditioning practitioner may decide to focus on improving endurance and flexibility, while also improving body composition (figure 13.22)."

Norms based on large samples are sometimes expressed in evenly spaced percentiles.

        "content": "pretation of the clinical significance of fitness testing (51). To describe and evaluate the magnitude of change in a fitness test, measures such as smallest worthwhile change and effect size are important. Smallest worthwhile change refers to the ability of a test to detect the smallest practically important change in performance. The ability to track changes with a fitness test depends on the validity and reliability of that test. The smallest worthwhile change can be determined in a number of ways, but it is typically calculated as 0.2 of the between-subjects standard deviation (51). For example, if the standard deviation for a vertical jump test is 10 cm in a group of female athletes, this would mean that the smallest worthwhile change for this group of athletes is 2 cm (0.2  10 cm). Effect size is a statistic that can be useful for calculat- ing group performance following a training program or comparing between groups of athletes (29). The effect of the training program can be calculated as the difference or change in the mean score as a proportion of the pretest standard deviation (equation 13.3). ES = (x posttest − x pretest) / SD pretest (13.3) For example, a group of athletes had a pretraining mean bench press 1RM of 104.5 kg (standard deviation of 5.7 kg), and after a 12-week training intervention the mean bench press is 111.7 kg. The calculated effect size would be equal to (111.7 − 104.5)/5.7 = 1.26. Several scales have been provided to compare the magnitude of the effect (19, 73, 94), but reference values for small (0.2), moderate (0.6), large (1.2), and very large (2.0) can be a useful starting point for practitioners (29, 51). For the example just given, this would mean that the strength and conditioning professional would inter- pret the effect size of 1.26 as meaning that the training program had a large effect."

        "content": "To determine the sport-specific training status of an athlete, the strength and conditioning professional can combine the results of selected tests to generate an athletic profile, which is a group of test results related to sport-specific abilities that are important for quality performance in a sport or sport position. When evaluat- ing athletes, the strength and conditioning professional should follow these six steps: 1.\t Select tests that will measure the specific parame- ters most closely related to the physical character- istics of the sport or sports in question. For exam- ple, a testing battery for wrestlers should include tests for pulling strength, pushing strength, and local muscular endurance. 2.\t Choose valid and reliable tests to measure these parameters, and arrange the testing battery in an appropriate order with sufficient rest between tests to promote test reliability. For example, appropri- ate tests for wrestling might include push-ups and sit-ups for maximum repetitions in a given time interval. These two tests should be separated by at least 10 minutes of rest to allow recovery from fatigue and thus promote accurate scores. 3.\t Administer the test battery with as many athletes as possible. 4.\t Determine the smallest worthwhile change for the tests and compare to normative data where appropriate. It is recommended that coaches store testing results and develop their own norms when standardized procedures are used. 5.\t Conduct repeat testing (e.g., pre- and posttraining program) and use the results to present a visual profile with figures. 6.\t Use the results of the testing in some mean- ingful way. Ideally the results will enable the strength and conditioning professional to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the athletes and to design the training program with these in mind."
